# Really-simple-notification-server

This is ready for testing. The client connects and a session is made. From there the listeners send messages to the queue which executes certain commands.
ADDCOMP - adds computer
REMCOMP - removes computer
UPDCOMP - updates computer status
UPDCLST - updates client status

I will add the parameters and command formatting later.
