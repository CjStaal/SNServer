# Really-simple-notification-server

I dont like how the damn clientConnection holds a reference to handler, and a reference to the clientinformation.
Seems like bad encapsulation.
I made this in 15 minutes, just so I had something to go on.
A wise man once told me, write something so it works, then start fixing it up.
So that's what I decided to do.
